        <h2>Time Cannot Be Influenced</h2>
        Time cannot be influenced by mankind.  It gives each of us a beginning and an end which makes us question what comes in between. But if we can create something time cannot erode, something that ignores the eccentricities of a particluar time or era, something truly timeless, that is the ultimate victory.
