    <h1>Time Cannot Be Influenced By Mankind</h1>
    Time cannot be influenced by mankind. It gives each of us a beginning and an end, which makes us question what comes in between. But if we can create something time cannot erode, something that igonores the eccentricities of a particular time or era, something truely timeless, that is the ultimate victory!
